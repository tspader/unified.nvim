--- Creates a debounced version of a function (Trailing Edge).
---
--- The debounced function delays invoking `func` until `delay_ms` milliseconds have
--- elapsed since the last time the debounced function was invoked. Subsequent calls
--- during the delay period will reset the timer. The function executes only
--- after the calls have stopped for the specified duration.
---
--- Useful for rate-limiting execution in response to frequent events like
--- 'TextChanged', 'CursorMoved', window resizing, etc.
---
--- @param func function The function to debounce. Will be called with arguments
---   passed to the debounced function on the trailing edge.
--- @param delay_ms number The debounce delay in milliseconds. Must be non-negative.
--- @return function A new function that wraps the original `func` with trailing debounce logic.
---
--- @usage
---   local async = require("utils.async")
---   local my_update_func = function(arg1) print("Updating:", arg1) end
---   local debounced_update = async.debounce(my_update_func, 300)
---
---   -- Call multiple times rapidly:
---   debounced_update("first")  -- Does nothing immediately
---   debounced_update("second") -- Does nothing immediately, resets timer
---   -- After 300ms pause following the *last* call...
---   -- "Updating: second" will be printed.
---
--- @note Return Value: The debounced function itself does not return any value from `func`.
--- @note Handling 'self': If `func` is a method that relies on `self`, you need to ensure `self`
---       is correctly passed, e.g., by wrapping:
---       `async.debounce(function(...) obj:method(...) end, delay)`

--- Runs `fn` as a fire-and-forget coroutine.
---
--- Any `job.await` calls made inside `fn` will execute asynchronously
--- (non-blocking) instead of blocking the UI thread, because `job.await`
--- detects it is running inside a coroutine and yields. Errors raised inside
--- `fn` are reported via `vim.notify` and never propagate to the caller.
---
